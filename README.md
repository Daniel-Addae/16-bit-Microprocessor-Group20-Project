# 16-bit-Microprocessor-Group20-Project
Designed the architecture and microarchitecture of a 16-bit microprocessor
Utilized Boolean Algebra and other digital circuit analyzation methods to build the specified microprocessor on paper
some operations implemented in the processor include ALU operations, branch operations, jump operations, load and store operations
Built a Register file capable of storing 16 bits of data
Built and simulated the microprocessor in Logisim
